Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This repository showcases a comprehensive implementation of various machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud. The project focuses on using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression models to classify fraudulent transactions.

Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry, leading to considerable financial losses. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions by leveraging machine learning techniques on a dataset of credit card transactions. The dataset, sourced from a public repository like Kaggle, is preprocessed to ensure consistency and reliability before model training.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Standardization: Applied to all features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is particularly important for models like SVM and Logistic Regression.
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets to enable an unbiased evaluation of the models.
Model Implementation:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for its effectiveness in handling complex, non-linear data using kernel functions.
Random Forest: An ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve classification accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, often effective with high-dimensional data, assuming feature independence.
Logistic Regression: A linear model commonly used for binary classification, providing interpretable results and simplicity in implementation.
Performance Evaluation:

Metrics: The models were evaluated using accuracy and precision to assess their ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions.
Comparative Analysis: The project includes a comparison of the models, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of each approach in the context of fraud detection.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for credit card fraud detection, with a focus on accuracy and precision as key performance metrics.
